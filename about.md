# About

My name is Neil Brown and I'm a .Net Developer / Software Engineer from the UK.

Though I've been working in I.T. for nearly 40 years, I still keep myself up to date with the latest Development technologies, frameworks and techniques. I try to infuse my enthusiasm for the industry into others and this site is just one way of doing that.

I've worked across many sectors, including a former Blue Chip company, the public Sector, a small start-up and a medium sized family business in Fintech.
